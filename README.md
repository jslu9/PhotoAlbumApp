# PhotoAlbumApp

Here I have developed the PhotoAlbumApp. For this project, which is an API for a social photo managing application, I decided to build the backend web service on Python and postgeSQL. I also developed the web service in the mindset of keeping it simple and easy to test. I used the Tornado framework for the web server, SQLAlchemy as the object relational model, and dependencies are handled with virtualenv (to deploy the isolated python environment use 'source venv/bin/activate'). The dependencies can be viewed in the requirements.txt file.   The service is built similar to a model-view-controller design. The models are represented by the models.py file, the controllers rely on queries.py and server.py, and the view is the json that is returned. 

The models.py code contains the logic to map python objects to the User, Albums, and Photos PostgreSQL tables. The queries.py code contains the methods that grabs the necessary data from database and returns the rows as objects. The server.py code implements the RESTful API. To setup up the database the user must first set the database connection string in settings.py file (ex 'postgresql://test@localhost:5432/photoalbums'). The user would then create a database called photoalbums using command 'createdb photoalbums'. Then run the command 'python models.py', which will create all the necessary tables in the database. Then to populate the tables with the photos and albums json data, execute the POST request '/photoAlbums/init'. This request will run a method that parses the '/json/albums.json' and '/json/photos.json' and adds the entities into the database.

Testing was conducted through the use of the Postman application. There I tested running the API by running the different CRUD methods.
